## Build Setup
Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 : `npm run dev`

Build for production with minification : `npm run build`

## Tips
- Mark `src` directory as source in your IDE
- Place all static files (images, fonts etc) in assets directory
- Make components as small as you can and collect them in page
- See how works router, component including and props passing, start from `router/index.js` file

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
